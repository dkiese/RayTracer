To compile, type:

make all

This will yield an executable called writepixels,
which writes the rendered image to TestScene.rgb which you will have to 
convert to .png using the command:

convert -size 512x512 -depth 8 TestScene.rgb File.png

The size of the image can be controlled within the file WritePixels.cpp

convert image.jpg -resize \>512x512 \
          -background black -gravity center -extent 512x512 \
          -depth 8  image.rgb
